/**
 *DFS follows one level of branch as down as many as possible until the target node is found or the end is reached.
 * ->DFS has lower memory requirement compare to BFS because it is not necessary to store all points as each level
 * -> As name suggest we go depth from root to child on left side and root to child on right side until found the value
 * ->All the way down come back up , all the way down come back up.....
 *
 *  DFS           Vs             BFS
 *
 *  1. Time complexity is same, O(n)
 *  ->BFS:
 *  cons:
 *  1. Shortest path
 *  2. Close nodes
 *  pros:
 *  1. More memory
 * ->DFS:
 * cons:
 * 1. less memory
 * 2. Does Path Exist?
 * pros:
 * 1. Can get slow
